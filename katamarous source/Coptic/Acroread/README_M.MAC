Here are the installation instructions for each platform:Windows	--  Run the SETUP.EXE program in the 16BIT (for Windows 3.x systems) or 32BIT		                     (for Windows 95 and NT systems) folder for the desired configuration:		ACROREAD / WIN              |___ READER 		               Acrobat Reader              |	       |___ 16BIT		          Windows 3.x              |	       |___ 32BIT		          Windows 95 and NT              |		      |___ QUICKTIM		       QuickTime 2.12 Installers	              |              |___ RDR_SRCH 	              Acrobat Reader + Search              |		      |___ 16BIT		          Windows 3.x              |			     |___ 32BIT		          Windows 95 and NT              |		      |___ QUICKTIM		       QuickTime 2.12 Installers              |              |___ DISKS	 	                Acrobat Reader (Disk-based Installer)              |        |___ 16BIT		          Windows 3.x              |        |___ 32BIT		          Windows 95 and NT              |              |___ ONEFILE	 	              Acrobat Reader (Single File Installer)                       |___ 16BIT		          Windows 3.x                       |___ 32BIT		          Windows 95 and NT		For example, the Acrobat Reader + Search installer for Windows 95 is:		ACROREAD / WIN / RDR_SRCH / 32BIT / SETUP.EXE		QuickTime installation is only required if you are viewing PDF files with linked QuickTime 		movies or sounds. See the README.WRI file in the QUICKTIM folder for installation details.		The DISKS folder contains the Acrobat Reader 3.0 installer files that may be copied to		empty, DOS-formatted HD floppy disks. 		The ONEFILE folder contains the Acrobat Reader 3.0 installer files that are most suitable for online    distribution (email, web, bbs, etc.).Macintosh	--  Run the "Install Acrobat Reader 3.0" program in the "Reader" folder of the 		                       desired configuration:		ACROREAD / MAC				          |___ Reader 		               Acrobat Reader 							      	|	       |___ Reader		         Reader Installer							      	|	       |___ OLE		            OLE Plug-in Installer							      	|	       |___ QuickTime		      QuickTime 2.5 Installer							      	|						      		|___ Reader+Search 	         Acrobat Reader + Search							      	|       |___ Reader		          Reader + Search Installer							      	|       |___ OLE		             OLE Plug-in Installer							      	|       |___ QuickTime		       QuickTime 2.5 Installer							      	|						      		|___ Disks         	         Acrobat Reader (Disk-based Installer)							      		       |___ Reader		          Reader Installer							      		       |___ OLE		             OLE Plug-in Installer							      		       |___ QuickTime		       QuickTime 2.5 Installer		  For example, the Acrobat Reader + Search installer for Macintosh is:		   ACROREAD / MAC / Reader+Search / Reader / Install Acrobat Reader 3.0				   QuickTime installation is only required if you are viewing PDF files with linked QuickTime 		   movies or sounds. Most likely, your Macintosh system already has QuickTime 2.0 or later      installed, which is required to play back QuickTime movies and sounds added to Portable 		   Document Format (PDF) files.		   Installation of the OLE plug-in is only required if you need to view PDF documents 		   embedded as OLE objects in another application, such as Lotus Notes. Unix	--  For installation instructions, see the INSTGUID.TXT file in the directory for the 		            desired configuration (all configurations are in the same directory):		ACROREAD / UNIX				           |___ READER 		               Acrobat Reader				           |				           |___ RDR_SRCH 	              Acrobat Reader + Search		For example, the Acrobat Reader + Search install script for Unix is:		   ACROREAD / UNIX / RDR_SRCH / INSTALL. For more information, see the 				     "Acrobat Reader Installers for Unix" section below.Distributing the Acrobat Reader Installers====================================You may make and distribute unlimited copies of the Acrobat Reader or Acrobat Reader + Search software on this CD-ROM, including copies for commercial distribution, as long as each copy that you make and distribute includes the following: 	1.

A single installation script senses what platform's components are present and lists those platforms as choices. The required files are the following:	INSTGUID.TXT		  The Reader installation guide	INSTALL		       The installation script	LICREAD.TXT 		  The End-User License Agreement which is required by the 				               installation script	READ.TAR		      The platform-independent files (on-line documentation, fonts, 				               etc.).This file is required by the installation script.The following files contain the platform-dependent components. If you do not want to distribute the Reader installation for a particular platform, such as Solaris, then do not inlcude that platform's file in the same directory as the other components of the installer.	AIXR.TAR		      The AIX platform-specific files	HPUXR.TAR		     The HP-UX platform-specific files	IRIXR.TAR		     The IRIX platform-specific files	SSOLR.TAR		     The Solaris platform-specific files	SSUNR.TAR		     The SunOS platform-specific filesFor example, to include the Reader installer for only AIX, the following files are needed in the same directory:	INSTGUID.TXT	INSTALL	LICREAD.TXT	READ.TAR	AIXR.TARACROREAD/UNIX/RDR_SRCH - This directory contains the above listed files plus files specific for Acrobat Search. The additional files are:	SEARCH.TAR		   The platform-independent files for Acrobat Search	AIXS.TAR		     The AIX platform-specific Search files	HPUXS.TAR		    The HP-UX platform-specific Search files	IRIXS.TAR		    The IRIX platform-specific Search files	SSOLS.TAR	    	The Solaris platform-specific Search files	SSUNS.TAR		    The SunOS platform-specific Search filesFor example, to include the Acrobat Reader + Search installer for HP-UX, the following files need to be in the same directory:	INSTGUID.TXT	INSTALL	LICREAD.TXT	READ.TAR	SEARCH.TAR	HPUXR.TAR	HPUXS.TARRe-use of Acrobat Reader 3.0 Documentation=======================================You may copy and re-use text and illustrations from any or all of the Acrobat Reader documentation (including Online Guides and ReadMe files) in your own publications associated with the distribution of Acrobat Reader 3.0 software. If you do so, you must include the following attribution line: "Some portions copyrighted to and reprinted with permission from Adobe Systems Incorporated."Customizing the Acrobat Reader Installers====================================You may customize the Acrobat Reader installers to install additional files such as plug-ins and help files. You cannot change the components that are built into the Acrobat Reader installer and its archives. Windows -- The Acrobat Reader installers for Windows have the ability to copy files that are external to the installer application and archives. To trigger the blind-copy mechanism, a file named ABCPY.INI (Adobe Blind CoPY initialization file) must exist in the same folder as the installer program (SETUP.EXE) for Acrobat Reader. The ABCPY.INI file specifies the source and destination locations for each file that is copied. Details for modifying this file can be found in ABCPYDOC.INI which is in the same folder as the installer (SETUP.EXE) for Acrobat Reader. An actual example of using ABCPY.INI can be found in the Acrobat Reader + Search installer on this CD-ROM.Macintosh -- The Acrobat Reader installers for Macintosh have the ability to copy files that are external to the installer application and archives. This is done by placing them in specially named folders, within the same folder as the installer application. In this way, files can be automatically copied to the Adobe Acrobat 3.0 folder on the destination hard drive. Standard folder names are:     	Plug-Ins    	Optional Plug-Ins    	Help1. Create a folder named (one of the choices above, exactly) at the same level as the installer application in the "Reader" folder.2. Put the appropriate files or folders (yes, it's recursive) into the folder you've created. Please put only the same type of files as the folder name. For example, plug-ins in the Plug-Ins folder, PDF files in the Help folder, etc.Note: The Installer checks to see if there is enough room on the target disk before installing the files in these external folders, but the copy will fail silently if there isn't enough room on the target disk. Also, the amount of space taken up by the additional files is --not-- included in the required space number in the Easy Install portion of the Installer.Unix -- You can add your own plug-ins or documents to be installed by the Acrobat Reader for Unix installer. To do so requires you to add one or more .tar files to the directory containing the installer components containing the additional elements you would like to install .Situation #1==========You have additional PDF files you would like installed into Reader/Help. Follow these steps:1. Create a directory structure of Reader/Help and place your additional files in the Help directory. Do NOT use your Reader installation area because any files in the Help directory when you make your .tar file will overwrite files of the same name that already exist in the installed image on the user's machine.For example, you've got a file, foo.pdf, you'd like to install into the Help directory. On your machine, set up a directory of Reader/Help/foo.pdf.	mkdir Reader/Help	cp -p foo.pdf Reader/Help	2. Change to the Reader directory.		cd Reader3. Create a .tar file of that directory and name it CUSTOM.TAR. The name CUSTOM.TAR should be used for any files to be installed that are platform-independent, such as help files. It is very important the files in the CUSTOM.TAR file are platform-independent.4. Place the CUSTOM.TAR file in the same directory with the other files of the installer.Situation #2:==========You want to install plug-ins for a specific platform.1. Create a directory for that particular platform and place the correct plug-in in the directory.	mkdir Reader/<platformdirectory>/plug_ins	cp -p fooplug.api Reader/<platformdirectory>/plug_ins	The <platformdirectory> must be one of the following:	hppahpux		      For HP-UX	mipsirix			     For IRIX	rs6000aix		     For AIX	sparcsolaris		  For Solaris	sparcsun		      For SunOS2. Change to the Reader directory.		cd Reader3. Create a .tar file of that directory and name it one of the following (appropriate for the platform):	HPUXC.TAR		    For HP-UX	IRIXC.TAR		    For IRIX	AIXC.TAR		     For AIX	SSOLC.TAR		    For Solaris	SSUNC.TAR		    For SunOS4. Place the .tar file in the same directory as the other files of the installer. "Includes Adobe Acrobat" Logo===========================A special "Includes Adobe Acrobat" logo is available from Adobe for use when distributing Acrobat Reader.
