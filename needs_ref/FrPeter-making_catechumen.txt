THE ORDER FOR RECEIVING A CATECHUMEN
 
In the Name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, One God. 

R. Amen. 
 
Almighty God, who willeth not that any should perish, but that all should come to the knowledge of the truth, even of His Son Jesus Christ, who is the Way, the Truth and the Life; who hath given unto thee to believe His word, to desire instruction in the faith, and to seek for His grace in the Sacraments of Baptism and Chrismation; of His great mercy grant unto thee all thy desire, and fulfil in thee the good pleasure of His will.

R. Amen. 
 
Let us pray.

O Holy Lord, Father Almighty, eternal God, regard in Thy compassion this Thy servant who hath hitherto wandered and strayed in error and uncertainty, in the midst of the darkness of this evil world. Expel from him, we beseech Thee, the spirit of evil; make plain unto him the way of truth; enlighten Thou his eyes, unstop his ears, and open his heart, that he may know Thee, the only true God, the Father in the Son, and the Son in the Father, with the Holy Ghost; and may be counted worthy to receive the fruit of this confession, both here and in the world to come : through Jesus Christ our Lord. 

R. Amen. 
 
The Lord Jesus Christ, our God, who with His finger did cast out devils, and came into the world that He might destroy the works of the devil; Deliver thee from Satan, and from all his evil powers; and cause him to depart from thee both now and for ever. The Lord deliver thee from every evil and unclean spirit; the spirit of deceit and guile, the spirit of idolatry and covetousness, the spirit of falsehood and of all uncleanness: that thou mayest be made meet for the Holy Ghost, and that He may take up His abode and dwell in thee for ever.

R. Amen. 
      In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, I sign  thee with the sign of faith, the sign of the cross of Christ: Be thou never ashamed of His cross, but confess the faith of Christ crucified, and continue His faithful soldier and servant unto thy life’s end.  

R. Amen.

Thou N. art anointed in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, One God. Oil of Catechesis for N. in the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church.

R. Amen. 
 
May this oil bring to nought all the assaults of the Adversary.

R. Amen. 
 
Let us pray.

Almighty and everlasting God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, mercifully regard Thy servant whom Thou hast vouchsafed to call to the rudiments of the faith, and upon whom we have set Thy sign in token of Thy good will and gracious purpose towards him. Deliver him, we beseech Thee, from all unholy and vain desires; remove from him all blindness of heart; instruct him in Thy holy mysteries; enable him to apprehend and embrace Thy truth; and speedily make him meet for the grace of Thy holy Baptism, and receive him unto the same: through the good will and grace of Thine Only-begotten Son, with whom, and with Thine all-holy, good and quickening Spirit, be Thou blessed for ever.

R. Amen.
 
The  blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, be with you all.

R. Amen.
